# Simple Shooter
This is a very simple FPS that I am developing to improve my graphics skills. It is currently in an extremely early stage of development, with very little other than extremely basic lighting, textures, and camera having been implemented.

Note: Development is effectively paused while I do a side game development project over the summer (the details of which cannot be shared here). As a result, this project is kind of in limbo with the code still in a pretty rough state.

Thanks also to the COMP3421 21T3 team at UNSW (of which I am a part), and in particular Simon Haddad, for creating the 
build system that I have slightly modified for this project.
